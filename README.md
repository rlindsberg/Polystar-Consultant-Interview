# Polystar-Consultant-Interview

This program reads all files in a given directory and counts the most common words. Right now it runs locally with a single thread.

The input files are dracula.txt and frankenstein.txt.

The results are [('the', 12483), ('and', 9018), ('i', 7692), ('to', 6919), ('of', 6517)], which looks reasonable.
